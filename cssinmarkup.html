    <!-- we will implement css in head which is called internal css -->
    <!-- inline css overwrites the internal css because inline is implemented later  -->
   <!-- the preferred means to use css is external css in which another css file is created and all the design component is written in that css file which is linked by the help of four css selectors which are: css element selector, css id selector, css class selector, css and css grouping selector though they can also be used in internal css-->
   <!--  writing external css-->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="startcss.css">
   <!-- css element selector -->
   <style>
        p{
            color: purple;
            background-color: yellow;
        }
    </style>
    <!-- css id selector -->
    <style>
        #thirdpara{
            color: aqua;
            background-color: rgb(50, 50, 200);
        }
    </style>
    <!-- css class selector -->
    <style>
        .redbackground{
            color:white;
            background-color: red;
        }

    </style>
    <!-- a css id selector is uniquely applied and it can be applied only to that specific element who possess that id otherwisee it will mot be added whereas css class selector can be used by many elements which contains that class -->
